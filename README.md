# gogogoscraper
scraper for gogoanime, written in go.

Go Go Go and never stop Going.

It's like a match made in heaven.

Honestly this project is kinda worthless bc you can just mess around with URL's and go to the video source. I just wanted to play around with Go.

WARNING: there may be some ads and popups (sometimes NSFW) on the video player because of the video source. I did not put the ad there, it's attached to the video source. Please ignore these the best that you can, and close them. -->

Sometimes you have to use the japanense name to search for the show, rather than the english.

You can run this program on your own computer with go installed using the command `go run .` or you can build it by using `go build` and then run the executable `./gogogoscraper`.

#### Possible improvements
- find the actual video file (mp4) to use
- make the fullscreen button on the video player trigger fullscreen in browser.
- make english names work for animes with japanese names and suggest shows based on the exact behavior of the gogoanime website.
