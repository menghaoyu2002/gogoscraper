Honestly this project is kinda worthless bc you can just mess around with URL's and go to the video source. I just wanted to mess around with Go.

Deployed on Heroku at https://gogogoscraper.herokuapp.com/

Please give my server some time to wake up, he's just tired.

Sometimes you have to use the japanense name to search for the show, rather than the english.

You can run this program on your own computer with go installed using the command `go run .` or you can build it by using `go build` and then run the executable `./gogogoscraper`.
